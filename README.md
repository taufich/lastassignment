 1. What is Logging?

Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. It involves capturing and storing messages generated by the software to help developers understand the application's behavior, troubleshoot issues, and monitor its performance. Logs can include various types of information such as errors, warnings, information messages, and debugging details.





2. Why Logging is Important

     -> Troubleshooting and Debugging: Logs provide insights into what happened in an application at a particular point in time, helping developers identify and resolve issues quickly.

     -> Monitoring and Maintenance: By analyzing logs, you can monitor the health and performance of an application, detect anomalies, and take preventive actions before minor issues become major problems.

     -> Auditing and Security: Logs can serve as an audit trail, providing a record of who did what and when. This is important for security and compliance, helping to detect unauthorized access or activities.

    -> Analytics and Reporting: Logs can be used to generate reports and perform analytics, providing valuable insights into user behavior, application usage patterns, and system performance.

    -> Accountability and Transparency: Maintaining logs ensures accountability and transparency, making it easier to track changes and decisions within the system.




   

3. Understanding Logging Levels

      -> DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. Used during development to get detailed insights into the application's behavior.
 
      -> INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level. Used to indicate normal but significant events.

      -> WARNING: Potentially harmful situations that do not cause the application to stop but may require attention.

      -> ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running. Indicates a significant problem that needs to be addressed.

      -> CRITICAL/FATAL: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort. Indicates a critical problem that may cause system failure.
